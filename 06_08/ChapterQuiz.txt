What is the value of defaultColor when it is logged in the console?
var defaultColor = "purple";

function setColor() {
    if ( defaultColor === "purple" ) {
        let defaultColor = "orange";
    }
}

setColor();
console.log(defaultColor);

You are correct!
"purple"
Feedback

The console.log statement happens in the global scope while the color is changed in a local scope where a separate let with the same name is created. let defaultColor only exists inside the function scope of setColor().
